# Emotiscope is Different

**This isn't the usual "sound-reactive LEDs" you've seen for years.**

**Emotiscope was built by [@lixielabs](https://leds.social/@lixielabs) from the ground up as an open, powerful bridge between sight and sound.** With a show that's reactive to notation, vibrato, tempo, and more, it produces very unique and pleasant-to-look-at light shows which synchronize to your music without any visible latency whatsoever.

With a show that’s reactive to notation, vibrato, tempo, and more, Emotiscope produces very unique and pleasant-to-look-at light shows which synchronize to your music without any visible latency whatsoever. A magic diffuser covers 128 of the world’s smallest addressable LEDs, which are being refreshed at up 450 FPS. Emotiscope doesn’t look like a screen, it looks more like some kind of neon-gas display from the far future or recent past.
